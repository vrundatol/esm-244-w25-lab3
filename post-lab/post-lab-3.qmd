## Data Load

```{r}
#import data from this website

wine_quality <- readr::read_delim("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv",delim=';')
 
```


## Design a research question

Examine the data to come up with an interesting research question based on the wine data. It is a large collection of wine attributes and quality ratings to indicate the sommlier's rating of the wine.

**What top 3 attributes determine the quality of wine?**

## Explore the data

Create some exploratory tables or charts to help you better understand possible relationships

```{r}

wine_quality_citric_plot <- wine_quality |>
  ggplot(aes(y = quality, x = `citric acid`)) +
  geom_point()

wine_quality_citric_plot

wine_quality_sugar_plot <- wine_quality |>
  ggplot(aes(y = quality, x = `residual sugar`))+
  geom_point()

wine_quality_sugar_plot

```
